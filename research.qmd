Click on the tabs to the left to see some research projects that I have been involved with, mostly linking to published papers.

Recently, my collaborators and I used deep learning to model animal movement in a step selection framework. You can check out the [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.13.638055v1) and the website with tutorials and code here: [https://swforrest.github.io/deepSSF/](https://swforrest.github.io/deepSSF/).
